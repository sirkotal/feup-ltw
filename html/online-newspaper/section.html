                    Make no mistake about it: Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice was built from the DNA of the Souls and Bloodborne series.
                    However, despite the trademark difficulty we've grown accustomed to in FromSoft games, Sekiro is something else - a stealth-action game, in some ways more cohesive and forgiving than Dark Souls, but 
                    way more brutal in others.
